# skiplist

This project contains a Skip List implementation in C++ with Python bindings.

* Works with any C++ type <T> that has comparison operators.
* No capacity restrictions apart from available memory.
* Heavily performance tested.
* Aimed at performing fast rolling median but can do rolling percentile equally well.
* Functional tests at both the C++ and Python level.
* Deterministic tests of a probablistic data structure.
* The C++ skip list has exhaustive internal integrity checks.
* The skip list can generate DOT files that provide a visualisation of its internal state.
* Extensive documentation.
